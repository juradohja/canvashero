A little exercise using HTML's canvas tag. Result is a guitar-hero-inspired game. The player has four readers (big squares), each of a different color. These must be pressed accordingly when a note (small square) of the same color passes through them in order to increment the score, displayed at the top-right corner. The interval between notes decreases linearly with time.
